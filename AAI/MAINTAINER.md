## Updating the specifications

As GA4GH standards, these specifications and guidance are subject to community review and discussion. If you would like to contribute or have any questions, please reach out to the Data Security Work Stream via https://www.ga4gh.org/contactus/

## Changes to the repository

Minor editorial fixes where there is no likelihood of controversy may be done directly on the **master** branch.
Larger changes should be proposed as pull requests so that they can be discussed and refined.
This way when the main repository is forked again, the new fork is created with a minimum of extraneous volatile branches.
